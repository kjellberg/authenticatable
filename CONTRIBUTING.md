Contributing to Authenticatable
-------------------------------

New contributors are very welcome and needed. Authenticatable is an open-source, community project that anyone can contribute to. Reviewing and testing is highly valued and the most effective way you can contribute as a new contributor. It also will teach you much more about the code and process than opening pull requests.

Except for testing, there are several ways you can contribute to the betterment of the project:
- **Report an issue?** - If the issue isn’t reported, we can’t fix it. Please report any bugs, feature, and/or improvement requests on the [Authenticatable GitHub Issues tracker](https://github.com/kiqr/authenticatable/issues).
- **Submit patches** - Do you have a new feature or a fix you'd like to share? [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/kiqr/authenticatable/pulls)!
- **Write blog articles** - Are you using Authenticatable? We'd love to hear how you're using it in your projects. Write a tutorial and post it on your blog!

### Development process
The `main` branch is regularly built and tested, but it is not guaranteed to be completely stable. Tags are created regularly from release branches to indicate new official, stable release versions of Authenticatable.

### Commit message guidline
A good commit message should describe what changed and why. The Authenticatable-project uses [semantic commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to streamline the release process.

Before a pull request can be merged, it must have a pull request title with a semantic prefix.
